## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned
- Centering using absolute position (https://thoughtbot.com/blog/positioning#centering-using-absolute-position)
The steps
  - Add `left: 50%` to the element that you want to center.
    You will notice that this aligns the left edge of the child
    element with the 50% line of the parent.
  - Add a negative left margin that is equal to half the width of the element.
    This moves us back onto the halfway mark.
  - Next, weâ€™ll do a similar process for the vertical axis. Add `top: 50%` to the child
  - And then add a negative top margin equal to half its height.

- Improving links and buttons accessibility with focus(https://moderncss.dev/modern-css-upgrades-to-improve-accessibility/#focus-visibility)


### Continued development


### Useful resources

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - using sass modules eg `@use "sass:color" `
- [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - sass compiler
